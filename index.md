# Technical Writing Portfolio

I am a technical writer specializing in documentation for developer-oriented software and database systems.
I have created this page to showcase my writing style.

## PostgreSQL documentation

As a technical writer at Postgres Professional, I created documentation for several PostgreSQL-based products,
which included both enhanced flavors of vanilla PostgreSQL and various extensions or utilities.
This section lists some examples of this work:

- A task topic created as part of the Intallation guide for Postgres Pro Standard:  
  [Configuring multiple Postgres Pro instances on Windows](docs/postgres_install_win.md)
- A concept topic that describes the jsonpath data type introduced in PostgreSQL for querying JSON data:  
  [jsonpath type](docs/jsonpath_type.md)  
  The original patch submitted to PostgreSQL is available in the
  [official PostgreSQL repository](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=72b6460336e86ad5cafd3426af6013c7d8457367).
- A reference topic that describes a utility for checksum validation:  
  [pg_integrity_check utility](docs/pg_integrity_check.pdf)

## Intel documentation

The projects that I supported at Intel Corporation were quite diverse but mostly
dealt with performance analysis. I include a couple of old snapshots to complete the picture:

- [Profiling OpenGL/OpenGL ES* frames with Graphics Frame Analyzer](docs/workflow_sample.pdf)
- [Data fitting functions](docs/function_reference_sample.pdf)


## Translated books

I have translated these books from Russian into English:

- [PostgreSQL Internals](https://edu.postgrespro.com/postgresql_internals-14_en.pdf)
- [Postgres: The First Experience](https://edu.postgrespro.ru/introbook_v9_en.pdf)
