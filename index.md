# Technical Writing Portfolio

I am a technical writer specializing in documentation for developer-oriented software and database systems.
I have created this page to showcase my writing style.

## PostgreSQL documentation

As a technical writer at Postgres Professional, I created documentation for several PostgreSQL-based products,
which included both enhanced flavors of vanilla PostgreSQL and various extensions or utilities.
The sections below provide several samples of this work.

### Reference

[pg_integrity_check utility](docs/pg_integrity_check.pdf)

### Task

This instruction was created as part of the Installation guide for Postgres Pro Standard.

[Configuring multiple Postgres Pro instances on Windows](docs/postgres_install_win.md)

### Concept

This is a description of the jsonpath data type introduced in PostgreSQL for querying JSON data.
The original patch submitted to PostgreSQL is available in the
[official PostgreSQL repository](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=72b6460336e86ad5cafd3426af6013c7d8457367).

## Intel documentation

The projects that I supported at Intel Corporation were quite diverse, but mostly
dealt with performance analysis. I include a couple of old snapshots to complete the picture.

- [Profiling OpenGL/OpenGL ES* frames with Graphics Frame Analyzer](docs/workflow_sample.pdf)
- [Data fitting functions](docs/function_reference_sample.pdf)


## Translated books

I have translated these books from Russian into English:

- [PostgreSQL Internals](https://edu.postgrespro.com/postgresql_internals-14_en.pdf)
- [Postgres: The First Experience](https://edu.postgrespro.ru/introbook_v9_en.pdf)
